# NCAR `pandas` Tutorial
Welcome to the UCAR/NCAR Xdev [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org) tutorial repository. This tutorial is scheduled for **Wednesday, May 21 2021** at **1:00 pm MDT / 1900 UTC** and will be led by **Drew Camron** and **Max Grover**.

## Prerequisites
A basic knowledge of Python, NumPy, and Matpolotlib is required. Comfort with Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab, as well as conda/pip is helpful. Familiarity with tabular data, e.g. `.csv` is important to understanding pandas and its strengths.

## Setup
1. Clone or otherwise download this repository using the green `Code` button above
1. [Install conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
1. From your terminal (macOS, Linux) or git bash/Anaconda Prompt/Powershell (Windows), execute the following from within this directory: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
1. Activate your new python environment with `conda activate ncar_pandas_tutorial`
1. Launch `jupyter lab` from this prompt
1. Open `pandas.ipynb`

If you have preferred ways to maintain your own environment or otherwise interact with Python, you'll only need to make sure you have `pandas` and `matplotlib` installed, and download at least `pandas.ipynb` and the `data/` directory.
